/**
 * Points up-front (PUF) is the current (as of April 2009) way of quoting CDSs. A CDS has a standardised coupon (premium) -
 * which is either 100 or 500 bps in North America (depending on the credit quality of the reference entity). An up front fee
 * is then payable by the buyer of protection (i.e. the payer of the premiums) - this fee can be negative (i.e. an amount is
 * received by the protection buyer). PUF is quoted as a percentage of the notional. <br>
 * A zero hazard curve (or equivalent, e.g. the survival probability curve) can be implied from a set of PUF quotes
 * (on the same name at different maturities) by finding the curve that gives all the CDSs a clean present value equal to 
 * their PUF*Notional  (the curve is not unique and will depend on other modeling choices).
