Notes for testing the RunTool.bat wrapper. The wrapper should be a best efforts attempt to run the
scripts if the ZIP was just unpacked onto a Windows workstation or server. It is NOT used when the
platform is installed from an MSI.

Clear environment of any:
	JAVA_HOME
	JRE_HOME
	JAVA_CMD
	CLASSPATH
	JAVA_OPTS
	MEM_OPTS
	GC_OPTS

Uncomment "set" in at the end of the script; it will report out the environment variables

1a.	No Java executable on the path
	Expect: error message, exit code 1805

1b.	Java.exe executable on the path
	Expect: successful invocation with default MEM and GC opts and CLASSPATH

2.	Set CLASSPATH to something in the environment, eg C:\
	Expect: successful invocation with CLASSPATH containing C:\ as well as OG paths

3a.	Create INSTALL_DIR\scripts\setenv.bat file containing:
		set MEM_OPTS=-Xms128m
		set GC_OPTS=-Xincgc
	Expect: successful invocation with custom MEM and GC opts

3b.	Set JAVA_OPTS to something in the environment, eg -ea
	Expect: successful invocation with additional "-ea" opts

4a.	Set JAVA_HOME to something invalid
	Expect: error message, exit code 3

4b.	Set JAVA_HOME to something valid
	Expect: successful invocation

5a.	Set JRE_HOME to something invalid
	Expect: error message, exit code 3

5b.	Set JRE_HOME to something valid
	Expect: successful invocation

6a.	Set JAVA_CMD to something invalid
	Expect: error message, exit code 3

6b.	Set JAVA_CMD to something valid (full path, with extension)
	Expect: successful invocation
