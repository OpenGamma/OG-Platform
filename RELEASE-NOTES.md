Security manager and user database [PLAT-6341, PLAT-6348]
  The user source and master has been replaced with a new implementation.
  No backwards compatibility was maintained (as the old code was not in active use).
  WARNING: The database migration code deletes the old database tables and replaces them with different tables.
  The Eclipse based security system has been replaced with Apache Shiro.
  By default, the system will start with a permissive security manager and a console warning.
  Add security to your system as follows:

  In the INI file, add:
 MANAGER.INCLUDE = classpath:common/common-shiro.ini
  before:
 MANAGER.INCLUDE = classpath:common/common-dbmasters.ini

  In the INI file, change the start of the [webBasics] section to be:
 [webBasics]
 factory = com.opengamma.component.factory.web.WebsiteBasicsComponentFactory
 configMaster = ::central
 userMaster = ::central
 passwordService = ::main

  In the config properties file, add:
 shiro.hashIterations = <an integer number of your choosing, say between 4,000 and 10,000>
 shiro.cryptoSalt = <a string phrase of your choosing, say between 8 and 30 characters>

 If you want to run with open permissive security, then add
 MANAGER.INCLUDE = classpath:common/common-shiro-permissive.ini
  before:
 MANAGER.INCLUDE = classpath:common/common-dbmasters.ini

Configuration compatibility
- No changes

Database compatibility
- No upgrade required

API compatibility
- [PLAT-5535] OG-Analytics: InterestRateFutureSecurityDefinition now implements FuturesSecurityDefinition. The toDerivative method does not take a 
  Double data anymore; it was suppose to represent the last settlement price, but this is handled at the "Transaction" level. InterestRateFutureTransactionDefinition 
  now implements FuturesTransactionDefinition.
- [PLAT-6333] OG-Analytics: InterestRateFutureOptionMarginXXX now extends FuturesXXX.

Analytics compatibility
- No expected differences

- PLAT-6049 - CombinedPositionMasterComponentFactory to use arbitrary number of masters
      This change will require modifications to server configuration files(.ini). It requires a default position master and a list of other masters that will be combined into a single positionmaster
      e.g
      [combinedPositionMaster]
      factory = com.opengamma.component.factory.master.CombinedPositionMasterComponentFactory
      classifier = combined
      defaultPositionMaster = ::central
      positionMaster0 = PositionMaster::user
      .
      .
      positionMasterN = PositionMaster::<classifier>

API compatibility
- [PLAT-3807] Regenerate curve/surface functions when new config objects added
  The method signature in FunctionConfigurationSource has changed - see Javadoc for detailed guidance.
  The VersionedSource SPI interface has been removed to support assumptions made by caching layers.

Configuration compatibility
- [PLAT-3807] Regenerate curve/surface functions when new config objects added
  The CompiledFunctionService instance used throughout should be constructed with a FunctionConfigurationSource,
  not a FunctionRepository in order to handle updates. Existing code will work, but adding config entries will
  still require a restart.

To 2.2.0-M3
-----------

API compatibility
- [PLAT-4969] Move convention expiry calculators
  The expiry calculators have moved package to com.opengamma.financial.convention.expirycalc.
  Organize imports should fix broken code.

- [PLAT-4955] Add full convention source and master
  Major refactor of convention code adding support by database.
  Add ConventionType class to give types a name.
  Rename Convention class to FinancialConvention.
  Rename ConventionVisitor class to FinancialConventionVisitor.
  Rename ConventionVisitorAdapter class to FinancialConventionVisitorAdapter.
  Renamed getConvention() methods on source to getSingle() and changed Class parameter to end.
  Move com.opengamma.financial.convention.percurrency package to .initializer and refactor.

Configuration compatibility
- [PLAT-4955] Add full convention source and master
  All convention master entries require work.
  Use 'com.opengamma.component.factory.master.InMemoryConventionMasterComponentFactory'.
  or 'com.opengamma.component.factory.master.DbConventionMasterComponentFactory'.
  Each have a 'populateDefaultConventions' option which can be set to true to initialize from hard coded values.
  The 'ConventionSourceComponentFactory' takes an extra 'conventionMaster' argument.  


To 2.2.0-M2
-----------

Configuration compatibility
- [PLAT-4236] Added ability to query functions via green screens.
  - 'functionConfigurationSource' property should be set on the WebsiteBasicsComponentFactory.
  - this will affect engine and fullstack type ini files, as well as any other ini where the WebsiteBasicsComponentFactory is used.
  - example configuration is provided in /examples-simulated/config/fullstack/fullstack-examplessimulated.ini


Database compatibility
- Version of ElSql library updated to v0.8.
This has a change in meaning for the @INCLUDE(:variable) tag.
If you have any application-specific .elsql files then they must be changed as follows:
Search for "@INCLUDE(:" and replace with "@VALUE(:"
Note that @VALUE does not have a space output after it, whereas @INCLUDE(:variable) did.


API compatibility
- The sub-classes of ValueProperties are no longer publicly visible. Details for correcting any affected code can be
  found in the Javadoc for the ValueProperties.isNearInfiniteProperties method.

- The representation of a dependency graph has changed. This affects the DependencyGraph and DependencyNode classes,
  and any uses of them. Graphs (and nodes) are now immutable and it is only possible to navigate a graph from root to
  leaf without maintaining additional data structures. This can reduce the memory foot-print of the application by
  allowing node instances to be shared between graphs. Additional methods have been added to DependencyGraphExplorer
  to provide similar functionality to the indices that were previously available for navigation.

- CompiledFunctionResolver, FunctionResolver, and FunctionRepository now have getFunction methods for retrieving
  metadata on a single function by the unique identifier held in a dependency node.

- ComputationTargetFilter is now an interface and is no longer extended from a dependency graph node filter.


To 2.2.0-M1
-----------

Configuration compatibility
- [PLAT-4684] To support managing market data snapshot from the UI, WebsiteBasicsComponentFactory entry in the .ini configuration files needs the following properties
  marketDataSnapshotMaster, 
  (liveMarketDataProviderFactory or marketDataSpecificationRepository), 
  viewProcessor,
  computationTargetResolver and
  volatilityCubeDefinitionSource
  
  Example configuration is provided in /examples-simulated/config/fullstack/fullstack-examplessimulated.ini

- [PLAT-4782] The legacy analytics web UI has been retired. WebsiteAnalyticsComponentFactory, which used to construct
  its server-side components, has been removed. Any instances of this can be safely deleted from component
  configuration .ini files.
  
- [PLAT-4804] SpringJettyComponentFactory has been replaced by EmbeddedJettyComponentFactory. Replacement default ini
  configuration is:
    [jetty]
    factory = com.opengamma.component.factory.EmbeddedJettyComponentFactory
    resourceBase = ${jetty.resourceBase}


Database compatibility
- No upgrade required


API compatibility
- [PLAT-4782] The legacy analytics web UI has been retired. The dependency on the CometD long-polling library, and the
  custom RESTful end-points that it used, have been removed.

- [PLAT-4381] A new setter has been added to ViewClient which allows a Map<String, String> of context values to be
set and propagated down to the associated view process so that it can be used to trace the progress of a request
through the system. It use the logback MDC mechanism (http://logback.qos.ch/manual/mdc.html) which means that any
context values can be output in log statements with a suitable configuration file.

- ExternalIdSearch is now immutable
